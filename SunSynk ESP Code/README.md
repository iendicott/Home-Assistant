# SunSynk-ESPHome

This project has been created to allow you to gain back control over your SunSynk Inverter. This applies to 3.68kW / 5.5kW and 8.8kW inverters.
Please not though, there are different versions of the inverter that have different ports and pin outs so you will need to check you own one.


## Components.

## Important Note : 5.5kW with Separate CAN & RS485 Ports.

Use Pins 1 & 7 as pin2 isn’t connected on the PCB

Pin1 = Orange/White = (A)

Pin7 = Brown/White = (B)
