# SunSynk-ESPHome

This project has been created to allow you to gain back control over your SunSynk Inverter. This applies to 3.68kW / 5.5kW and 8.8kW inverters.
Please not though, there are different versions of the inverter that have different ports and pin outs so you will need to check you own one.


## Components.

WEMOS ESP32 Lite V1.0.0 Lolin32 Wifi Bluetooth Board CH340G MicroPython.

USB power supply and suitable enclosure.

I also created a 3D printed box which can be downloaded from here https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6456451

## Connections.

## 5.5kW & 8.5kW with combind BMS 2in1 Port.

The 8kW inverter uses a combined BMS 2in1 Port located below.

You should in this case use these pins and coloured cables

If you have the battery and RS485 linking to the same port you maye need to provide a splitter.
Not all splitter ae the same. In this version you can see it's crossed over.

You will need one like this https://solar-assistant.io/shop/products/deye_rj45_split

## Important Note : 5.5kW with Separate CAN & RS485 Ports.

Use Pins 1 & 7 as pin2 isnâ€™t connected on the PCB

Pin1 = Orange/White = (A)

Pin7 = Brown/White = (B)
